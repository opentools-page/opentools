## Introduction

Creating an open registry of tools that can be used by LLMS to ensure accurate, up-to-date context

The registry, known as opentools, is designed with a modular architecture - each module is designed
to be able to work indepdently of one another. 

The only configuration required from the devloper is the use of their own key for the tools that they are using. For more information on this, please look further into the configuration overview below. Please note that each module
has its own readme and details for each of the methods utilised so it is easy to set up.
